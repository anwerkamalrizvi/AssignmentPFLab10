## Problems (qn.c)
<br>1. Write a recursive function that calculates the sum of digits of a number. For example, if
the input is 123, the output should be 6.
<br>2. Write a recursive function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
<br>3. Write a program that uses structures to manage flight information, including flight
number, departure city, destination city, date, and available seats. Create functionalities
to book a seat and display flight details.
<br>2. Write a program that use a structure to hold information about movies, such as title,
genre, director, release year, and rating. Write a program that allows users to add new
movies, search for movies by genre, and display all movie details.

## More Problems (mpn.c)
<br>1. Write a recursive function that takes an array and its size as input and prints all the
elements.
<br>2. Define a structure to represent a point in 2D space with x and y coordinates. Implement
functions to calculate the distance between two points and to check if a point lies within
a specific rectangular boundary.
<br>3. Create a program with a constant that defines the maximum allowable temperature (in
Celsius). Write a function to compare input temperatures and use a static variable to
count how many times temperatures exceeded the limit.
<br>4. Create a structure to store details about cars in a dealership, including make, model,
year, price, and mileage. Write a program that allows users to add new cars, display a
list of available cars, and search for cars by make or model.
<br>5. Write a recursive function bubbleSort that takes an array and its size. It performs the
bubble sort algorithm by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if
they are in the wrong order.
<br>6. Design a structure to store information about travel packages, including package name,
destination, duration, cost, and number of seats available. Write a program that allows
users to book a travel package and display available packages.
<br>7. Create a C program that defines a constant for the conversion factor of meters to
kilometers. Use a static variable in a function to count how many times the function is
called.
<br>8. Write a recursive function linearSearch that takes an array, its size, the target element
to search for, and the current index. It checks if the target is at the current index and
continues searching in the subsequent indices until it either finds the target or exhausts
the array.
